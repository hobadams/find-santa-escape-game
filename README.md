# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

steps

- kitchen - clean up like grandma would taught you. bottles in order
- upstairs, get a text from eddy saying how much time you have and that it smells like carrots
- go to kids room, days of christmas put in correct order
- you notice there is a news paper in the corner with the magic square game
- last you notice some cards flipping (card flipping game)
- you hear ghost calling you to the next room
- you enter the sewing room. a deep ghost voice says - i am voodoo boo boo...the ghost of bad mistakes. I'm trapped in this bloody manaquin...
- Voodoo boo boo thanks your for saving them and shows your a trap door that smells like mince pies and must be where Santa is
- basement
- Santa is trapped down their and can't get out of. there is a word search (your name). enter it into the lock.
